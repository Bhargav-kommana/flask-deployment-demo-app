In this project, I built a complete end-to-end deployment flow and learned how real-world AWS and DevOps setups work, starting from infrastructure creation to automated application deployment.

Here’s what I worked on and learned during this project:

🔷 Provisioned AWS infrastructure using Terraform
🔷 Containerized a Flask application using Docker
🔷 Stored and managed Docker images in Amazon Public ECR
🔷 Set up CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
🔷 Automated deployment to an EC2 instance via SSH

This project provides you solid hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and AWS services, and helps to understand how these tools come together in real production-like environments.
